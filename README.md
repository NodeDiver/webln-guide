# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Lightning Web Standard (WebLN). 
This guide covers how to build a Bitcoin Lightning-driven web application using the WebLN standard.

Bitcoin is a global payment protocol that anyone with Internet access can participate in and contribute to. Hence, Bitcoin Lightningâ€™s use cases are as vast as its user base. However, building them does not need to be complicated. We designed this guide to help anyone get started quickly. We canâ€™t imagine every possible use case, but we can help you to build for them.

You may be interested in reading this guide if you want to build or operate a web application

* that accepts or makes Bitcoin Lightning payments
* that have decentralized identity and authentication

All you need is to interact with a client application such as a browser extension that understands WebLN. It does so by providing a JavaScript API called `window.webln` on every web page you visit. To have a look at what this object looks like, have a look at the [WebLN Reference](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/) or just type `window.webln` in the Chrome or Firefox DevTools console.

WebLN is a JavaScript interface to the Bitcoin Lightning Network. There are functions to:

* Get information about a user's Bitcoin Lightning node ([`webln.getInfo`](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/))
* Send a payment ([`webln.sendPayment`](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/))
* Request an invoice to receive a payment ([`webln.makeInvoice`](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/))
* Request a signature of an arbitrary message ([`webln.signMessage`](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/))
* â€¦and [some more](building-lightning-apps/webln-reference/)

When a WebLN provider is installed, any front-end code can get access to all these functions, and interact with the Bitcoin Lightning network. These web applications are called _LApps_ (Lightning Apps).
