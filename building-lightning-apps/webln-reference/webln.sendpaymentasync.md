# ðŸ†• webln.sendPaymentAsync()

Request that the user sends a payment for an invoice. The application needs to provide a [BOLT-11](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) invoice. The payment will only be initiated and will not wait for a preimage to be returned. This is useful when paying [HOLD invoices](https://guides.getalby.com/alby-guides/alby-browser-extension/features/hold-payments). There is no guarantee that the payment will be successfully sent to the receiver. It's up to the receiver to check whether or not the invoice has been paid.
